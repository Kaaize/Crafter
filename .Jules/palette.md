## 2024-10-25 - Copy Link Feedback Pattern
**Learning:** Users often lack confidence that "Copy Link" buttons actually worked without explicit feedback. Using `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` combined with a temporary text change ("Copied!") and a visual state change (e.g., green background) provides immediate, delightful confirmation.
**Action:** When implementing copy-to-clipboard actions, always include a visual success state that reverts after ~2 seconds. Ensure to handle race conditions if the user clicks multiple times rapidly.
